    "I've always wanted to build an end to end ml solution - starting with model creation and ending with a live web app. Here I've managed to do it. Users are able to submit a picture of a skin lesion and get an instant prediction. This kernel details the process I followed to build the model and then convert it from Keras to Tensorflow.js. The javascript, html and css code for the app is available on github. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Web App:<br>http://skin.test.woza.work/<br>\n",
    "Github: <br>https://github.com/vbookshelf/Skin-Lesion-Analyzer<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This model classifies skin lesions into seven classes. It is a fine tuned MobileNet CNN. All training was done in this kernel. The main challenges were the unbalanced dataset and the small amount of data.  I used data augmentation to reduce the class imbalance and in so doing get categorical accuracy scores that were not heavily skewed by a single majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "MobileNet’s small size and speed makes it ideal for web deployment. It’s also a joy to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow.js is a new library that allows machine learning models to run in the browser - without having to download or install any additional software. Because the model is running locally, any data that a user submits never leaves his or her pc or mobile phone. I imagine that privacy is especially important when it comes to medical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the objective?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found it very helpful to define a clear objective right at the start. This helps guide the model selection process. For example, if a model has an accuracy of 60% it would usually be seen as a bad model. However, if it also has a top 3 accuracy of 90% and the objective requires that it output 3 predictions then it may actually be quite a good model. \n",
    "\n",
    "*This is the objective that I defined for this task:*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create an online tool that can tell doctors and lab technologists the three highest probability diagnoses for a given skin lesion. This will help them quickly identify high priority patients and speed up their workflow. The app should produce a result in less than 3 seconds. To ensure privacy the images must be pre-processed and analysed locally and never be uploaded to an external server.\n"

There is, however, agreement that these lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma - which is usually not pigmented. Both neoplasms commonly show surface scaling and commonly are devoid of pigment. Actinic keratoses are more common on the face and Bowen’s disease is more common on other body sites. Because both types are in- duced by UV-light the surrounding skin is usually typified by severe sun damaged except in cases of Bowen’s disease that are caused by human papilloma virus infection and not by UV.
